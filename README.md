# IOT-Connected-Alarm
Not long time ago, while sleeping I had a minor fire incident. Thank God we were home and our non connected fire alarm begun buzzing so loud that I begun dreaming the fire brigade is with us. That was lucky, cause we were home. 

But what about the times when you're not at the location of fire, gas and CO2 leakage ? One might say, the non connected alarm will do its job and save the place ... From my last experience which happend at 2.00 in the morning, no neighbours came to see if we are ok or at least to check what happend. That after 10 minutes of alarm buzzing. So during daytime, when the neighbours start sensing something wrong - if they arent at the job -  its already too late to save much.  

Worse than that, lets say you have a CO2 leakage while sleeping. I know persons who died while sleeping because of that.

So my project is to create an connected alarm ( Smoke, Gas, CO2 and maybe other things ) which will send notifications thru SMS  to its OWNER if its day time and to a third SAFE person which could come and save the OWNER or notify the police, if the OWNER didnt dismissed the alarm after 30 seconds or so.
